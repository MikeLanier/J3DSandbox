#Notes
Regarding the addition of non-rotating text. I was thinking of adding
non-rotating text to the Sandbox.SixFaces model, but, the way I have things 
wired up in the app, everything I add to the display will rotate. 
Maybe I need a layer above the root Sandbox.Xform where non-rotating stuff can
be added. Something I didn't want to dive into at the time since I had
basic display working and didn't want to break it.  The more I learn,
the more I want to complicate things. Eventually, I'll come back to 
this. (09/15/2017)

A circular helix of radius a and slope b/a (or pitch 2Ï€b) is described by the following parametrisation:

    x (t) = a cos(t)
    y (t) = a sin(t)
    z (t) = bt.
